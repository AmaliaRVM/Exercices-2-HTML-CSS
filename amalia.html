 <p>I am from Mexico City, but have been based in Brussels since 2012. 
I have a background as an actress and puppeteer, and concluded in 2014 a master in performing arts. <br>
Since then, I have been developing an artistic practice in which I am interested to question in the performativity of space and performances 
in public spaces.<br>
I'm currently learning code, it's fun!
